-PAUP: nexus format input for PAUP analysis on local machine interactive interface of PA\
UP software
-Phylip: consist of R scripts that runs the transposition (Transposition_Scripts); Input\
 for transposition (Transposition R input); and Input for Phylip.dnapars program (intera\
ctive Phylip interface on local machine)
-RAxML: Command lines used to run RAxML for MelGal5 minMinor1 and minMinor2 datasets. An\
alysis using RAxML includes to generate best likelihood tree (BLK), bootstrapping, pairw\
ise topological Robinson-Folds distances(RF) between maximum likelihood trees and consen\
sus tree. Model implied on the analysis: GTRGAMMA
